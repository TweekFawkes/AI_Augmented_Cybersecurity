# Quick Save Command

Perform a quick local git commit to save current work state for easy restoration.

## Steps:
1. Check git status to see what files have changed
2. Stage all changes (including untracked files)
3. Create a commit with a timestamp-based message: "Quick save: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
4. Confirm the commit was successful
5. Display a brief summary of what was saved

## Important:
- This is a LOCAL commit only - do NOT push to remote
- Use descriptive output so the user knows what was saved
- If there are no changes to commit, inform the user
- Always include the timestamp in the commit message for easy reference
