## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server or dependencies required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation

1. Navigate to the application directory:
```bash
cd /Users/brycekunz/Documents/GitHub/AI_Augmented_Cybersecurity/test/new_webapp
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
```bash
# macOS
open index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html

# Windows
start index.html
```

Alternatively, you can use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server -p 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage Guide

### Navigation

- Client-side only (no server vulnerabilities)
- No cookies or third-party tracking
- Local storage only for user progress
- Content Security Policy friendly

## Customization

### Modifying Content
Edit `app.js` and update the `moduleContent` object to customize module content:

```javascript
const moduleContent = {
    1: {
        title: "Your Module Title",
        content: `Your HTML content here`
    },
    // ... more modules
};
```

### Updating Quiz Questions
Modify the `quizQuestions` array in `app.js`:

```javascript
const quizQuestions = [
    {
        question: "Your question?",
        options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
        correct: 0  // Index of correct answer (0-based)
    },
    // ... more questions
];
```

### Styling Changes
Edit `styles.css` to customize colors, fonts, or layout. CSS custom properties are defined in the `:root` selector for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    --background: #0f0f1e;
    --text-primary: #ffffff;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```
